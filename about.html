          <h2>Just a Bit About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm Brady Koenig, an IT Support Specialist who enjoys solving problems, setting up clean systems, and keeping tech running the way it should. I've got a strong work ethic, a calm approach to troubleshooting, and a genuine interest in anything that helps people work smarter.</p>
          <p>Outside of work, I'm into gaming, music production, and messing with side projects that give me new things to learn or build. I like when things just work, and I'm always looking for ways to make that happen, whether it's on a help desk, in code, or in my own space.</p>
